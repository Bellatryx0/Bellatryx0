Hi, Iâ€™m Bellatryx. I work a kinda crappy factory job but Iâ€™m learning to code on the side â€” mostly Java for now.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning:  
- Java (console projects and fundamentals)  
- Git (just getting into it!)  
- Software engineering basics  

ðŸ”¨ Projects:  
- Cute command-line calculator (WIP)  
- More tiny Java things to come...

ðŸ’¡ Fun fact:  
Anne Frank was a magical girl in *Madoka Magica*. Yes, really.
