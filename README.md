Hi, I’m Bellatryx. I work a kinda crappy factory job but I’m learning to code on the side — mostly Java for now.

🌱 Currently learning:  
- Java (console projects and fundamentals)  
- Git (just getting into it!)  
- Software engineering basics  

🔨 Projects:  
- Cute command-line calculator (WIP)  
- More tiny Java things to come...

🖤 Likes:
- Games (Outer Wilds's the bestest)
- Music (Tpab's the bestest²)
- Anime (Monogatari series's the bestest³)

💡 Fun fact:  
Anne Frank was a magical girl in *Madoka Magica*. Yes, really.
